"""WebSocket transport for the tui_gateway JSON-RPC server.

Reuses :func:`tui_gateway.server.dispatch` verbatim so every RPC method, every
slash command, every approval/clarify/sudo flow, and every agent event flows
through the same handlers whether the client is Ink over stdio or an iOS /
web client over WebSocket.

Wire protocol
-------------
Identical to stdio: newline-delimited JSON-RPC in both directions. The server
emits a ``gateway.ready`` event immediately after connection accept, then
echoes responses/events for inbound requests. No framing differences.
